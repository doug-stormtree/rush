title: Beat The Heat
question: >-
  Smokin’ hot spells are happening now with climate change. Is your
  neighbourhood a heat island?
section_one:
  positive_title: You're cool if...
  positive_points:
    - 'when you pinpoint your location on the map, it is not in a red heat dome.'
    - the pavement around you is permeable.
    - >-
      you have shady places of refuge, cool buildings, and drinking fountains
      nearby.
    - your area follows the tree equity rule.
  negative_title: Start sweating if...
  negative_points:
    - when you pinpoint your location on the map it is in a red heat dome.
    - >-
      there is lots of dark impermeable dark pavement around you that traps and
      radiates the sun’s heat.
    - >-
      your region doesn’t offer cool places of refuge like air-conditioned
      buildings, shady parks, and drinking fountains.
    - your neighbourhood does not follow the tree equity rule.
section_two:
  title: Create a cool climate.
  positive_points:
    - >-
      Figure out whether your community meets the tree equity rule and call your
      municipality if it doesn’t. Extending and connecting natural spaces across
      urban landscapes will help keep us cool and moist.
    - >-
      Identify large areas of pavement that radiate heat.  Talk to your
      municipal leaders about better options including permeable or light
      coloured pavement, and to create more shading in those spaces.
    - >-
      Stay on the sidewalk to avoid compacting soil. Healthy loose soil
      processes harmful greenhouse gasses twice as much as plants do. The
      partnership between trees, soil and the atmosphere is key to a healthy
      climate.
    - >-
      Re-invent your yard.  Create multiple layers of greenery for shade,
      habitat, moisture, and to turn greenhouse gasses into beautiful plants and
      food.  Introduce a variety of plants to keep your ecosystem working even
      in the hot months that are tough on grass.
    - >-
      Keep the shoreline shaded to protect the creatures of the intertidal zone
      from dying of heat. These water-filtering creatures clean and maintain the
      water quality in the ocean every day, free of charge. We humans don’t know
      how to provide this service, nor could we afford to provide it on the
      scale at which it naturally occurs.
    - >-
      Advocate for your community to increase public green spaces and cooling
      architecture.

All life is vulnerable to extreme heat. Prolonged heat dries out landscapes, increases risk of fires, can shorten growing seasons, and create conditions for viruses and bacteria to thrive. 

High temperatures also threaten biodiversity by drying out habitats and directly increasing the body temperatures of the critters who live there. 70% of human sudden deaths recorded in BC during the heat wave of 2021 were due to extreme temperatures.

Research shows that communities with a lower income in Canada’s largest cities don’t have access to as much green space. This means more stress and mental health challenges that make it even harder to make ends meet and makes folks more vulnerable to heat events.

This same research points to the 3-30-300 standard. The Global Deal for Nature concludes that we need to protect at least 30% of the planet by 2030. Saanich is on board, having committed to at least 30% urban forest cover.

While ocean breezes can cool neighbourhoods closer to the shore, making more space for Nature and decreasing dark non-draining pavement will support a cool microclimate consistently.
